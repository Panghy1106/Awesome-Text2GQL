# TuGraph-DB ChatBot

This is the repository for the text2GQL generator implementation. Awesome-Text2GQL aims to generate cyphers/gqls and corresponding prompts as training corpus for fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Based on TuGraph-DB, the training corpus helps to train the Text2GQL and Text2Cypher models that are suitable for TuGraph-DB query engine capabilities.
